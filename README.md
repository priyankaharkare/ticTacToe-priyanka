USER STORIES:
- As a user, the game should be simple.
- As a user, the game should fun
- As a user, the game rules should be clear
- As a user, I want to be able to play this on the computer( and on other mobile devices)
- As a user, my game will reset as soon as there's a winner and a new game will begin

GAME Instructions
- The goal of tic-tac-toe is to be the first player to get three in a row on a
3 x 3 grid, or four in a row in a 4 x 4 grid.<

- To start, one player draws a board, creating a grid of squares,
 usually 3 x 3 or 4 x 4.

- The player who is playing "X" always goes first

- Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either one player has
three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally; or all nine squares
are filled

- If a player is able to draw three of their Xs or three of their Os in a row,
 then that player wins.

- If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row,
the game is a draw.

THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO DO IF I HAD MORE TIME:
Probably add more style and some information on the page. Would have liked to
use modals for the login information and wanted to use modals for some
'fun facts' and 'instructions too'.
I would have tried to figure out how multiple players could play on different
devices as well.

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS:
I started with a wireframe and some user stories for the project. I then spent
some time in trying to figure out the order of steps. Once i knew what to do,
i started with the basic HTML to create a board and some buttons on the page that
i could later add event handlers to. The board was made using bootstrap and
other elements were CSS.
I then worked on the User Authentication part and made sure that it was
working.
Next, i worked on the GameLogic which took the longest time for me. I had
many different ideas of how i could possibly do it, but it got a bit complex
as i approached it. I eventually used a very simple logic for the GameLogic.

Once, that was working, I worked on the Game API part. I was a bit confused
initially on how to do this, but eventually understood what had to be done.
