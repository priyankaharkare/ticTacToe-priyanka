<p>The goal of tic-tac-toe is to be the first player to get three in a row on a
3 x 3 grid, or four in a row in a 4 x 4 grid.</p>

<p>To start, one player draws a board, creating a grid of squares,
 usually 3 x 3 or 4 x 4.</p>

<p>The player who is playing "X" always goes first.</p>

<p>Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either one player has
three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally; or all nine squares
are filled.</p>

<p>If a player is able to draw three of their Xs or three of their Os in a row,
 then that player wins.</p>

<p>If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row,
the game is a draw.</p>


<p>Gameplay is the same if you are playing on a 4 x 4 grid. The "X" player goes first.
And, players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until a row is completed
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or all 16 squares are filled.
If all 16 squares are filled and neither player has four in a row,
the game is a draw.
